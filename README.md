# Overview

As a software engineer, I am continuously striving to deepen my knowledge of various programming languages, particularly C#. To this end, I developed a basic console-based password manager to familiarize myself with C#'s syntax, and object-oriented programming principles.

This password manager is a console application written in C#. It allows users to add, view, and delete website entries along with their associated usernames and passwords. The data is persisted in a text file, providing basic functionality of a file-based database.

The primary purpose of writing this software was to demonstrate my understanding of key programming concepts, including variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, file I/O operations, and structures in the C# language.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my text editor, equipped with the C# plugin for syntax highlighting and IntelliSense. For building and executing the program, I used .NET Core's Command Line Interface (CLI).

The programming language used is C#, and the .NET Core framework provided the libraries used in the program, such as System, System.Collections.Generic, and System.IO.

# Future Work

There are several enhancements that can be made to this application in the future:

* Add data encryption for secure storage of usernames and passwords.
* Add user authentication to access the password manager.
* Improve user interface for better user experience.
* Integrate with a real database for better data management and integrity.
* Handle exceptions and edge cases to make the program more robust.
